This project aims to develop a basic hospital management system that enables doctors to easily input their personal and professional information. 
The system is designed to manage various medical specialties, allowing the hospital to add new specialties as needed.
These specialties are then presented to doctors as options when entering their data.
Moreover, doctors are granted the ability to view, edit, and delete their own data, fostering a sense of ownership and control over their information.
The system is built using a combination of modern technologies including C#, Entity Framework, and ASP.NET.
